Juice configuration assistance




This repository contains multiple sub-projects:

* Language-specific libraries to allow applications to access configurations. These libraries allow a program to seamlessly
switch between configuration sources (e.g. Flat Files, and Amazon Secrets Manager).

* The client library `juice-client-nodejs` also provides a CLI (command line interface)
for updating config files in a production environment.

* `juice-spa` and `juice-api` provide a web-based tool for defining applications,
their dependancies, and the environments in which they run. This tool may be accessed publicly
at http://juiceconfig.com, or can be run privately inhouse from an Open Source Docker image.
